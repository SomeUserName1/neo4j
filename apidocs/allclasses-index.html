 Concepts describing the part of a node containing the data
 Total space - The space available for data (pageSize - headerSize)
 Active space - Space currently occupied by active data (not including dead keys)
 Dead space - Space currently occupied by dead data that could be reclaimed by defragment
 Alloc offset - Exact offset to leftmost key and thus the end of alloc space
 Alloc space - The available space between offset array and data space
